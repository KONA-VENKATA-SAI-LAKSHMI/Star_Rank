Introduction to Business Problem :
===
In this project we will try to give a "NUTRITION RATING" for all the drinks available at 'Starbucks',i call it as "THE STAR RANK"

Background :
===

Taking nutritious food is vey important to our health,it also helps us to be fit.There are many number of beniftis by taking a 'coffee' for instance,Two cups of coffee can cut post-workout muscle pain by up to 48%(From the Journal of Pain, March 2007).

Moreover every time we go out for a meeting some one,we might probably endup at a  coffee shope like Starbucks(mostly in-case of dates).Since Starbucks is the most popular in it's kind we focus on the coffees by it.
                                      
So, we will try to determine the nutrition rank of the coffees.

Target audiences :
===

>__coustomers__ :        Esspecialy those who are in a diet.

>__cooks__ :                 Gives a better scope of evaluating their creation.

>__stake holders__ :     This allows them to set prices according to the nutrition rank.

Result :
===

__Here we observe that the 1'st labeled cluster/coffees are "The most nutrisious",i.e they'll be awarded with 5/5 Star Rank rating.__

Then comes 3'rd labeled cluster/coffees are The best coffees with lowest "caffine" content in them,hence they are awarded with __4/5 Star Rank rating__.

The __3/5 Star Rank rating__ can be give to The 4'th labeled cluster/coffees which are "rich in Carbohydrates"

The __2/5 Star Rank rating__ can be give to The 2'nd labeled cluster/coffees which are for mostly "new" coustemers..

The __1/5 Star Rank rating__ can be give to The 5'th labeled cluster/coffees which are for those who are in "need of Caffeine" which is not recommendble for a good health..
